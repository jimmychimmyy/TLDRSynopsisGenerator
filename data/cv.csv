young girl named katie, is sitting alone, until the captain of the boat himself offers the dance. elsewhere, a hand presses a lever that unravels a thin wire cord from a spool. the spool snaps and the wire slices across the dance floor like a blade, bisecting the dancers. only katie is spared, due to the captain leaning protectively over her, and her height. the captains face splits open at mouth level as the top of his head falls off as katie screams in horror. 40 years later, a boat salvage crewcpt. sean murphy, maureen epps, greer, dodge, munder, and santos is celebrating a recent success at a bar, when jack ferriman, a canadian weather service pilot, approaches them and says he has spotted a mysterious vessel running adrift in the bering sea. because the ship is in international waters, it can be claimed by whomever is able to bring it to port. the crew sets out on their ship, the arctic warrior, an ocean salvage tugboat. they discover the ship is the antonia graza, which mysteriously disappeared in 1962 and was believed to be lost at sea, as both the crew and the passengers were never heard from again. when they board the ship and prepare to tow it, they discover that it contains a large quantity of gold. however strange things begin to happen. epps claims to have seen a little girl on the stairwell. greer claims to have heard a woman singing throughout the ship. epps and ferriman discover the corpses of another salvage crew. they decide to leave the ship but take the gold, but an invisible force opens a gas valve in the engine room and the arctic warrior explodes as the engine is started, killing santos and leaving them stranded. they attempt to fix the antonia graza and sail it back to land, but the crew members are picked off one by one. greer meets francesca, the singer who he heard, who seduces him and then leads him off a precipice to his death. captain murphy, after entering the captains cabin, comes across the ghost of the antonia grazas captain, who explains that they recovered the gold from a sinking cruiseship lorelei, along with a sole survivor. he shows murphy a picture of the survivor, who he is shocked to recognise. he rushes to tell the rest of the crew, but a supernatural force causes him to see everyone he meets as the burned ghost of santos, causing the crew to think he has gone mad and lock him in the drained fish tank. meanwhile, epps meets katie, who reveals that the crew of graza turned on the passengers and each other. the sole survivor of the lorelei convinced the crew of the graza to turn on the passengers in order to claim the gold. the crew killed all of the passengers, including katie, but then turned on each other. the last officer, after killing his crew mates was shot by the singer, francesca. another man then joined francesca in an embrace and walked away as a large hook swung into her face, killing her. the man is revealed as jack ferriman, who is actually a demonic spirit who

summons four of their five children mdash the fifth lives thousands of miles away in california mdash to break the news and decide where they will live until they can get back on their feet. only one of the children, nell, has enough space for both, but she asks for three months to talk her husband into the idea. in the meantime, the temporary solution is for the parents to split up and each go to live with a different one of the children. the two burdened families soon come to find the respective parents presence bothersome. nells efforts to talk her husband into helping are half hearted and achieve no success, and she reneges on her promise to eventually take them in. while barkley continues looking for work to allow him and his wife to live independently again, it is obvious that he has little or no prospect of success. when lucy continues to speak optimistically of the day that he will find work, her teenage granddaughter bluntly advises her to face facts that it will never happen because of his age. lucys sad reply is to say that facing facts is easy for a carefree 17 year old girl, but that at lucys age, the only fun left is pretending that there aint any facts to face... so would you mind if i just kind of went on pretending with no end in sight to the uncomfortable living situation, each of the host families looks for a way to get the parent they are hosting out of their house. when barkley catches a cold, his daughter cora seizes upon it as a pretext to assert that his health demands a milder climate, thus necessitating that he move to california to live with daughter addie there. meanwhile, son george and his wife anita begin planning to move lucy into a retirement home. lucy accidentally finds about their plans, but rather than force george into the awkward position of breaking the news to her, she goes to him first and claims that she wants to move into the home. meanwhile barkley resigns himself to his fate of having to move thousands of miles away, though he too is entirely aware of his daughters true motivation for sending him. on the day barkley is to depart by train, he and lucy make plans to go out and spend one last afternoon together before having a farewell dinner with the four children. the couple have a fantastic time strolling around the city and reminiscing about their happy years together, even visiting the same hotel in which they had stayed on their honeymoon 50 years prior. their day is made so pleasant partly because of the kindness of various people they encounter, who, although strangers, seem to find them a charming couple, to genuinely enjoy their company and to treat them with deference and respect. this, of course, stands in stark contrast to the treatment the two are receiving from their children, and eventually barkley and lucy decide to continue their wonderful day by skipping the farewell dinner and dining at the hotel instead. when barkley informs their daughter of their decision with a blunt phone call, it prompts introspection among the four children. son robert suggests that each of the children has always known that collectively they are probably the most good for nothing bunch of kids that were ever raised, but it didnt bother us much until we found out that pop knew it too. george notes that it is now so late in the evening that they wont even have time to meet their parents at the train station to see their father off. he says that he deliberately let the time pass until it was too late because he figured their parents would prefer to be alone. nell objects that if they dont go to the station, their parents will think were terrible, to which george matter of factly replies, arent we at the train station, lucy and barkley say their farewells to one another. on the surface, their conversation echoes lucys comments to her granddaughter about preferring to pretend, rather than facing facts. barkley tells lucy that he will soon find a job in california and then quickly send for her, and lucy replies that she is sure he will do so. they then offer each other a truly final goodbye, saying that they are doing so just in case they do not see each other again because anything could happen. each makes a heartfelt statement reaffirming their lifelong love for the other, in what seems an unspoken acknowledgment that this is almost certainly their final moment together.	an elderly couple are forced to separate when they lose their house and none of their five children will take both parents in	the couple summons four of their five children mdash the fifth

meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, richard sol, ainsley, and bender. he also meets his roommate charles herman, a literature student, and an unlikely friendship begins. nash comes under increasing pressure to publish, both from the mathematics department chairman and in the form of rivalry with hansen. but he refuses until he finds a truly original idea. his inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. hansen quotes adam smith and advocates every man for himself, but nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. this leads to a new concept of governing dynamics which nash develops and publishes. on the strength of this he is offered an appointment at mit where sol and bender join him. some years later, nash is invited to the pentagon to crack encrypted enemy telecommunication. nash is able to decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other codebreakers. he considers his regular duties at mit uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by mysterious supervisor william parcher of the united states department of defense, to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a soviet plot. nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns and believes he is followed when he delivers his results to a secret mailbox. meanwhile a student, alicia larde, asks him to dinner, and the two fall in love. on a return visit to princeton, nash runs into his former roommate charles and meets charles young niece marcee, whom he adores. with charles encouragement he proposes to alicia and they marry. nash begins to fear for his life after witnessing a shootout between parcher and soviet agents. he tells parcher that he wants to quit his special assignment but parcher blackmails him into staying. while delivering a guest lecture at harvard university, nash attempts to flee from what appear to be foreign agents, led by dr. rosen. after punching rosen in an attempt to flee, nash is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility. he believes the facility is run by the soviets who are trying to extract information from him. dr. rosen tells alicia that nash has schizophrenia and that charles, marcee and parcher exist only in his imagination. alicia investigates and finally confronts nash with the unopened documents he had delivered to the secret mailbox. nash is given a course of insulin shock therapy and eventually released. frustrated with the side effects of the antipsychotic medication he is taking, he secretly stops taking it. but this causes a relapse and he meets parcher again. after an incident where nash endangers his infant son and accidentally knocks alicia and the baby to the ground, she flees the house in fear with their child. nash steps in front of her car to prevent her from leaving. he tells alicia, she never gets old, referring to marcee, who although years have passed since their first encounter, has remained exactly the same age and is still a little girl. with this, he finally accepts that although all three people seem real, they are in fact part of his hallucinations. against dr. rosens advice, nash decides not to restart his medication, believing that he can deal with his symptoms in another way. alicia decides to stay and support him in this. nash approaches his old friend and rival, martin hansen, now head of the princeton mathematics department, who grants him permission to work out of the library and audit classes. years pass and as nash grows older he learns to ignore his hallucinations. eventually he earns the privilege of teaching again. in 1994, nash is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics, and goes on to win the nobel memorial prize in economics for his revolutionary work on game theory. the movie ends as nash and alicia leave the auditorium in stockholm nash sees charles, marcee, and parcher standing to one side and watching him.	after john nash, a brilliant but asocial mathematician, accepts secret work
