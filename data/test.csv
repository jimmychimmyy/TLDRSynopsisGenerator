113464	hannah and her sisters	1986	the story is told in three main arcs, with almost all of it occurring during a 24 month period beginning and ending at thanksgiving parties hosted by hannah and her husband, elliot. hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative her own story as a successful actress is somewhat secondary, but most of the events of the film connect to her. an adulterous romance between elliot and one of hannahs sisters, lee, provides the main romantic entanglement of the film. elliot attributes this to his discontent with his wifes self sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength. lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, frederick, who is much older. she finds her relationship with frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of fredericks professed interest in continuing to teach her. she leaves frederick, much to his sorrow, after he discovers her affair with elliot. for the remainder of the year between the first and second thanksgiving gatherings, elliot and lee carry on their affair despite elliots lingering inability to end his marriage to hannah. lee finally ends the affair during the second thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else. mickey, as both the former husband of hannah and the eventual husband of holly, is shown primarily in scenes outside of the primary story. all of the scenes that take place outside of the 24 month period of the primary story involve flashbacks from mickeys previous marriage to hannah, hannah and mickeys struggle with infertility, his subsequent role as a surrogate father to hannahs children, and his first date with hannahs sister holly. aside from these flashback scenes, mickey is depicted within the timeline of the main story dealing with hypochondria, his professional and creative conflicts in the television industry, and an existential crisis that leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion to catholicism and an interest in krishna consciousness. ultimately, an unsuccessful suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the marx brothers duck soup in a movie theater. the revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with holly, which this time blossoms quickly into love and marriage. hollys story is the films third main arc. a former cocaine addict who is depicted as the more insecure and least talented of the three sisters, shes an unsuccessful actress who shifts from one career aspiration to another in order to find success. after borrowing money from hannah, she starts a catering business with april, a friend and fellow actress. holly and april end up as rivals in auditions for parts in broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect they are each attracted to. holly abandons the catering business after the romance with the architect fails and decides to try her hand at writing. the career change forces her once again to borrow money from hannah, a dependency hannah perhaps welcomes and holly resents. she writes a script inspired by hannah and elliot, which greatly upsets hannah. it is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of hannah and elliots marriage that had been conveyed to holly through lee. although this threatens to expose the affair between elliot and lee, elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details. holly then sets aside her script due to hannahs objections, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date. a minor arc in the film tells part of the story of norma and evan played by maureen osullivan, mia farrows actual mother, and lloyd nolan, who were both in never too late. they are the parents of hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own. their own tumultuous marriage revolves around normas alcoholism and alleged affairs, however, the long term bond between them is evident in evans flirtatious anecdotes about norma while playing piano at the thanksgiving gatherings. by the time of the films third thanksgiving, lee has married someone she met while taking classes at columbia, meanwhile hannah and elliot have reconciled their marriage. the films final shot reveals that holly has now married mickey and that she is pregnant. part of the films structure and background is borrowed from ingmar bergmans fanny and alexander. in both films, a large theatrical family gather for three successive years celebrations. the first of each gathering is in a time of contentment, the second in a time of trouble, and the third showing what happens after the resolution of the troubles. the sudden appearance of mickeys reflection behind hollys in the closing scene also parallels the apparition behind alexander of the bishops ghost.	between two thanksgivings two years apart, hannahs husband falls in love with her sister lee, while her hypochondriac ex husband rekindles his relationship with her sister holly	the story is told in three main arcs, with almost all of it occurring during a 24 month period beginning and ending at thanksgiving parties hosted by hannah and her

informing him of his wifes infidelity, he still denies the possibility. one year later, layla abandons charlie and runs off with shont leaving charlie to raise three biracial sons who are the products of laylas adulterous affair with the limo driver. charlie never sees his wife again. charlie raises his illegitimate triplet sons using very vulgar language and spoiling them with sweets and unbalanced diets. charlies three sons become obese and foul mouthed young adults, but they are also highly intelligent and they treat charlie much better than anyone else. his wifes affair and abandonment leaves charlie so emotionally damaged that he lets himself be abused and taken advantage of by others. despite his friendliness and his being a police officer, the townspeople reject charlies authority with open scorn. after many years of continuous abuse by the people around him, his anger builds up and charlie develops a rude and violent split personality named hank, caused by advanced delusionary schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage. as hank, he goes around retaliating against anyone who has accosted him and even harms those who really havent. a psychiatrist prescribes a medicine to keep hank suppressed. believing that charlie needs a vacation, his commanding officer, orders him to escort a woman named irene waters from rhode island to massena, new york, because she reportedly committed a hit and run. irene insists the hit and run accusation was created by dickie, irenes mob connected ex boyfriend, and corrupt police officers in his employ. when some hit men arrive with a contract on irenes life, charlie agrees to help her escape, while a united states environmental protection agency agent is killed by the hit men. charlie leaves his medicine behind, causing his alter ego, hank, to surface any time he wants. the fbi suspects that charlie is responsible for assassinating the epa agent. the fbi joins charlies commander in pursuing charlie and irene. charlies sons pretend to work with the police to find their father, but throw the police off his trail and even steal a police helicopter to get to charlie before the police do. along the way, irene and charlie grow close. however, hanks random appearances both disgust and frighten irene. hanks aggression and resourcefulness aid in their survival, but irene finds herself attracted to charlie. hank tells irene the truth about charlies life, and how years of humiliation have destroyed charlies confidence as a man and a police officer. hank has plastic surgery performed on charlies face, and uses hours of careful cunning to trick irene into sleeping with him by posing as the good natured charlie. they meet a mild mannered but mysterious young man named whitey. they continue their journey as a trio, until whitey calmly tells charlie the story of how he brutally murdered his entire family. charlie and irene, frightened by this, sneak away in the night. meanwhile, dickie orders corrupt agents to kill both charlie and irene. after they fail, dickie decides to settle the matter himself. during the confrontation with dickie, charlie finally manages to eliminate the alternate personality and regain the courage to rescue irene. eventually, he manages to stop dickie, but only after dickie shoots off one of charlies thumbs. charlie is also aided in the fight by whitey, who reappears to throw a lawn dart into dickies back killing him. charlie thanks whitey for saving his life, and apologizes for making him kill again, but whitney then explains that he made up the story in order to seem cool to charlie, and that his family now lives in arizona. with hank gone, and dickies crew dead or behind bars, irene is finally free to return to her old life. however, just after she drives away from charlies house, the rhode island state police fakes an arrest on her and gives charlie a chance to propose to her.	a nice guy cop with dissociative identity disorder

12421231	the brave engineer	1950	the film opens with an overhead shot of a sprawling railroad yard in the morning, where all the trains are fast asleep. the shot begins to focus on a single train no. 2, an american 4 4 0, which is caseys, which is slow asleep, and eventually cuts to a closeup of the cab window, where casey is revealed to be sleeping in his engine cab. doffing his bedclothes, he checks his watch and realizing that he is behind schedule, hurriedly readies the engine to depart. mail is loaded aboard the train and with a toot on the whistle, casey sets off at a dangerously high speed through the maze of switches and sidings, nearly t boning two other trains in the process before making it safely out of the yard. at first, the trip is uneventful and we see casey relaxing in a rocking chair in front of the open firedoor, casually stoking it one piece of coal at a time as if it were a parlour stove. further on, however, the weather turns nasty, flooding the tracks like the bed of a creek and all but swamping the train. eight hours late, but nonetheless undaunted, casey climbs up on the cab roof and uses his coal shovel as a paddle. before long, he has cleared the flood and is on his way again. no sooner is the train back up to full speed, though, then casey is forced to bring it screeching to a halt standing in the middle of the tracks grazing, is a large brown cow which finally moves aside after much shouting and whistle blowing on caseys part. unfortunately, a new problem presents itself. a stereotypical villain with a black handlebar mustache has tied a lady to the tracks in front of caseys train. unwilling to waste any more time stopping, casey rushes forward and stands on the engines cowcatcher, scooping the terrified woman up just seconds in the moment in which the train is about to run her over. the villain turns to the camera and exclaims theatrically, curses foiled again casey is in such a hurry now, that he doesnt even stop to let her off, depositing her in the arms of a pleasantly surprised station master as he rushes past the next platform at full speed. hours later, night has fallen and we find caseys engine steaming full bore through a narrow, snow covered mountain pass. as the train passes over a high trestle spanning a gorge however, another stereotypical villain who is not on the level nearly brings things to an explosive end. once again undaunted by a seemingly impassable obstacle, caseys engine struggles, huffing and puffing, up the side of the gorge and continues on its way. a short while later, the camera focuses on a backside shot of a group of armed men on horseback as they watch the train from up on a hillside. casey is about to get his train attacked by train robbers the next shot finds the whole gang inside the cab, brandishing their guns and knives menacingly. at first, casey is so caught up in stoking the boiler, that he is oblivious to their presence. it is only after he inadvertently picks up one of the robbers along with a shovel full of coal that he finally notices the uninvited company. even then, casey is more annoyed by the distraction than anything else and begins to fight the robbers, hitting them repeatedly with his coal shovel while continuing to stoke the boiler. after quickly throwing the last of the would be thieves off the train, casey checks his watch and is horrified to discover that the robbers have put him behind schedule once again. determined to make up for lost time whatever the cost, he opens the throttle so wide that he actually rips the handle from its mount and throws it away. the scenery outside quickly becomes a blur as the train travels faster and faster. he adds more coal to the furnace, and, when running out, he also uses his shovel and rocking chair, until the ribbing on the engines boiler exterior is forced off. casey gives the engine some running repairs while the train roars down a hill. just a bit away a double headed slow freight train, double headed by a pair of 2 8 0s is chugging towards casey, who is too busy fixing the engines dome to notice. the brake man runs up to the engine to tell casey about the oncoming double headed slow freight train is coming, but fails to get the message, and jumps off the train after saying so long., but heres a goof. after jumping from the train, the brakeman is still seen on the engines roof in the next shot. the crews of the double header who are approaching all gasp and abandon the train as well and run for cover and, just as casey begins to notice, he finally gasps egad one more time before, the two trains begin to collide with a large explosion. afterwards, we are taken to a station, presumably the one casey is meant to terminate at, and, casey being late, the porter fears the worst. then, much to his joy and surprise, casey rolls down the hill in the remains of his engine carrying a bag of mail. a beaten up casey then shows his watch with pride, it stating he is on time almost. and the narrator says next time, take the train	legendary engineer casey jones is determined to keep his train schedule and nothing is going to stop him	at first, the trip is

resorted to extreme cost cutting techniques and embarrassing promotional antics to keep local interest alive. dunlop, while not particularly talented as either a player or coach, is a skilled con man, and regularly manipulates the team to his own advantage. during a hopeless season, the team picks up the hanson brothers, bespectacled violent goons with childlike mentalities, complete with toys in their luggage. horrified at being given players who seem stupid, immature, and unreliable, dunlop initially chooses not to play them. when it is announced that the local mill will be closing and 10,000 workers will be unemployed, dunlop grows concerned about the teams future. he makes several attempts to learn the identity of the teams anonymous owner, but is deftly deflected by mcgrath each

false story with eccentric sports news writer dickie dunn that a florida retirement community is interested in purchasing the team, in order to bolster the confidence of the players and to hopefully inspire an actual sale. most of the players, such as dave killer carlson embrace the shift, but braden, a college educated player with a clean style, resists every chance to fight. bradens failing

alcoholism, dunlop establishes a friendship between her and his estranged ex wife francine. meanwhile, the chiefs tactics get them into a great deal of legal trouble and make them a number of enemies, in particular, the syracuse bulldogs and their mercurial leader tim doctor hook mccracken, who is determined to pummel dunlop after a humiliating defeat. when the chiefs success fails to make any real progress, dunlops patience wears out. he uses an embarrassing past homosexual advance from mcgrath to blackmail him into revealing the identity of the teams owner a wealthy widow named anita mccambridge. amused at dunlops optimism, she compliments him on his clever manipulations, but admits that she cares little for hockey and despises the violence. she informs dunlop that while he has made the team a viable commodity for a lucrative sale, she would rather fold it to procure a tax write off. appalled at her indifference, dunlop insults her and storms off. completely defeated, and

them on board to play their final game straight old time hockey. the syracuse bulldogs, the chiefs opponents, have abandoned their original lineup and stocked their roster with an assembly of the most

storms into the locker room and angrily informs them that the stands are full of nhl scouts. hearing this, dunlop and the chiefs change their minds and turn the remainder of the game into an all out brawl. while sulking on the bench, braden spots lily in the stands with francine. enthralled by her makeover and attendance, he skates out to center ice and strips off his uniform, prompting the

the remainder of the film is set in east berlin, spanning from october 1989 to just after german reunification a year later. alex lives with his sister, ariane, his mother, christiane, and arianes infant daughter, paula. his father fled to the west in 1978, apparently abandoning the family. in his absence, christiane has become an ardent idealist and supporter of the ruling socialist unity party of germany. alex takes part in an an anti government demonstration, where he meets a girl by chance, but they are separated by the riot police before they could properly introduce themselves. when christiane sees alex being arrested, she suffers a near fatal heart attack and falls into a coma. the police ignore alexanders plea to assist his mother, instead releasing him later that evening to go and see her. while visiting his mother at the hospital, alex again meets the girl from the demonstration, who is revealed to be lara, a young nurse from the soviet union taking care of his mother. alex becomes smitten with her and asks her out. the two soon begin dating and develop a close bond. shortly afterward, the berlin wall falls. in that time, capitalism comes to east berlin, and alex loses his job before winning a new position in a lottery to install satellite dishes with west berlin resident denis domaschke, an aspiring filmmaker with whom alex quickly becomes good friends, while ariane leaves university to work at a burger king drive through. after eight months, christiane awakes, but is severely weakened both physically and mentally. her doctor asserts that any shock might cause another, possibly fatal, heart attack. alex realises that the discovery of recent events would be too much for her to bear, and so sets out to maintain the illusion that things are as before in the german democratic republic. to this end, he, ariane and lara revert from the gaudy decor of the west to the drab decor they previously had in the bedroom of their mother in the family apartment, dress in their old clothes, and feed christiane new western produce from old labeled jars. their deception is successful, albeit increasingly complicated and elaborate. christiane occasionally witnesses strange occurrences, such as a gigantic coca cola advertisement banner unfurling on a building outside the apartment. with denis help, alex edits old tapes of east german news broadcasts and creates fake reports on tv to explain these odd events. as the old news shows were fairly predictable, and christianes memory is vague, she is initially fooled. christiane eventually gains strength and wanders outside one day while alex is asleep. she sees all her neighbours old furniture piled up in the street for garbage collection and advertisements for western corporations. she also sees an old statue of lenin being flown away by an mi 8 helicopter, which seems to reach out to her. however, alex and ariane quickly find her, take her home, and show her a fake special report that east germany is now accepting refugees from the west following a severe economic crisis there. christiane, initially skeptical, finally decrees that as good socialists, they should open their home to these newcomers. the family decides to go to their dacha at christianes suggestion. while they are there along with lara and arianes new western boyfriend, rainer, christiane reveals her own secret her husband had fled because the party had been increasingly oppressing him, and the plan had been for the rest of the family to join him in west berlin. however, christiane, fearing the

family bankrupt, marries into the wealthy chen family, becoming the fourth wife or rather the third concubine mdash or, as she is referred to, the fourth mistress mdash of the household. arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, master chen, the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shown. songlian soon discovers, however, that not all the concubines in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. in fact, the master decides on a daily basis the concubine he will spend the night with whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants. pitted in constant competition against each other, the three concubines are continually vying for their husbands attention and affections. the first mistress, yuru, appears to be nearly as old as the master himself. having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to live out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger concubines. the second mistress, zhuoyun, befriends songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift she also warns her about the third mistress, meishan, a former opera singer who is spoiled and who becomes unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the masters playthings. as time passes, though, songlian learns that it is really zhuoyun, the second mistress, who is not to be trusted she is subsequently described as having the face of the buddha, yet possessing the heart of a scorpion. songlian feigns pregnancy, attempting to garner the majority of the masters time and, at the same time, attempting to become actually pregnant. zhuoyun, however, is in league with songlians personal maid, yaner who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraud. zhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for songlians pregnancy. doctor gao, who is

yaner falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital. one of the servants tells songlian that her former maid died with her mistresss name on her lips. songlian, who had briefly attended university before the passing of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude she eventually sees the competition between the concubines as a useless endeavor, as each woman is merely a robe that the master may wear and discard at his discretion. as songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a concubine in the chen household. on her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent over her bitter fate, songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between meishan and doctor gao to zhuoyun who later catches the adulterous couple together. following the old customs and traditions, meishan is dragged to a lone room on the roof of the estate and hanged to death by the masters servants. songlian, already in agony due to the fruitlessness of her life, witnesses the entire episode and is emotionally traumatized. the

science officer, fred kwan as the chief engineer, gwen demarco as the computer officer, and tommy webber as a precocious child pilot. guy fleegman played a security officer who was quickly killed off in his only appearance on the show, in episode 81. eighteen years after the show was cancelled, as a galaxy quest convention full of costumed fans is underway, jason is approached by a group of people whose leader, mathesar, says that they are aliens called thermians. jason goes with them to what he assumes will be an amateur filming session, but the thermians really are aliens, octopoidal creatures using appearance generators, a device that makes them appear human. technologically advanced but having no concept of fiction, they have mistaken broadcasts of galaxy quest for historical documentaries and modelled their society on the ethos presented in the episodes. they have invented and built real versions of the technologies portrayed in the show, including the protector. the thermians transport jason onto the protector to negotiate with sarris, a reptilian humanoid warlord waging a genocidal war against the thermian people. sarris demands the omega 13, a device used at the very end of galaxy quests final episode. still believing the situation is fictional, jason orders the thermians to fire upon sarriss spaceship and then insists on returning home, but when they send him through space to earth, he finally realizes the events were real. the thermians then come back to earth and ask for more help negotiating a surrender with sarris. jason, believing sarris is the one to surrender, asks his co stars to join him, and they agree, believing that the mission is just an acting job. once the actors are onboard the protector, they finally realize the truth, but sarris prevents them from leaving, so they assume their television roles in order to save the thermians, who have very little concept of deception, or the art of actingtheater. sarris chases the protector into a space minefield, which damages the beryllium sphere that powers the ships reactor. the actors acquire a new sphere from a nearby planet after battling various alien creatures, but when they return to the ship, sarris has boarded it and taken control. sarris interrogates jason about the omega 13 and forces him to admit the truth about galaxy quest to mathesar, who is heartbroken after learning that jason and his crew are make believe. sarriss men activate the ships self destruct sequence, but jason and alexander use a gambit from one of the shows episodes to kill the aliens guarding them. not knowing how the ship works, jason then contacts an avid galaxy quest fan named brandon in his suburban home on earth, using a vox communicator that he accidentally swapped at a promotional store opening. brandon and his friends use their extensive knowledge of the ship to help jason and gwen abort the self destruct sequence. when jason asks brandon what the omega 13 does, brandon says that while some people believe it was a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in 13 seconds, he and others believes it is a time machine that sends its user 13 seconds into the past. with jason in command of the protector, the actors and thermians destroy sarris ship and set course back to earth. sarris sneaks aboard the protector and starts killing the crew, but jason activates the omega 13, is sent back in time 13 seconds, and thwarts his attack. as the thermians take control of the ship, the actors detach the command deck and land on earth with brandons help, accidentally crashing into the building where the galaxy quest convention is taking place. they emerge from the wreck to enthusiastic applause from the audience, who assume the crash is part of the entertainment, and when sarris attacks again, jason kills him with an ion nebulizer and receives even greater applause. later that year galaxy quest is revived, starring the original cast, along with laliari, a female thermian who chose to stay on earth as freds lover, and with guy playing the ships chief of security, roc ingersol.	the alumni cast of a space opera television series have to

borrow the tree of neighbor wes trogdon who is going away for a couple of days. luther and spike try to transport it across the street on spikes radio flyer wagon, only for the neighbors to confuse this to be luther stealing the familys christmas tree, and to be stopped by the police, who assume they have stopped a robbery in progress. spike comes to luthers rescue. nora comes home enraged at

house and goes across the street to the scheel home. bevs cancer, once in remission, has returned and, knowing this may be their last holiday together, luther insists they take the cruise in place of him and nora, going so far as to offer to take care of their hated cat, muffles, whos always under luthers foot. at first they decline, but ultimately they accept his generosity, and luther, whose

637256	waterworld	1995	in the future, the polar ice caps have melted, and the sea level has risen hundreds of meters, covering every continent. human population has been scattered across the ocean in individual, isolated communities consisting of artificial islands and mostly decrepit sea vessels. an antihero drifter known only as the mariner, sails the seas in his trimaran. he enters an artificial atoll seeking to trade dirt, which is a precious commodity. it is later revealed that he is a mutant with webbed feet and gills, an evolutionary step to accommodate the changes in climate. the fearful atollers vote to recycle him by drowning him in a yellow sludge brine pool. at that moment pirates, known as smokers, raid the atoll, having been tipped off by a smoker spy posing as a trader, known as the nord. the smokers are searching for an orphan girl named enola, who has what appears to be a map and directions to dryland tattooed on her back. the girl and her guardian, helen, the atolls shopkeeper, plan to escape with gregor, the atolls expert inventor, in the hopes of finding dryland. unfortunately, gregors escape method, a hot air balloon made of old rags, launches too early with him on it, leaving helen and enola stranded. they instead escape with the mariner, who agrees to take them with him because they saved his life, though he is ill at ease with their company, as he prefers solitude, and finds them to be a nuisance. chasing them is the deacon, who is the captain of a derelict oil tanker, the exxon valdez and the leader of the smokers. he wants the map to dryland and has a number of skirmishes with the mariner while trying to get enola. after helens naive actions during a battle with the smokers results in significant damage to the mariners boat, he angrily cuts their hair very short. after this incident, the mariner gradually warms up to them and teaches enola to swim. helen, convinced that dryland exists, demands to know where the mariner finds his dirt. the mariner, able to breathe underwater, puts her in a diving bell and swims down to the ruins of denver, where he collects the dirt and other items from the bottom of the sea for trade. while they are underwater, the deacon and his smokers board the boat, burn it and capture enola, while the mariner and helen barely escape. since helen cannot breathe underwater, the mariner breathes for the both of them, resulting in an underwater kiss of life. they resurface and board the wreckage of the mariners trimaran, where they are later rescued by gregor. he takes them to a new makeshift atoll where the survivors of the first atoll attack have regrouped. using a jet ski, the mariner chases down the exxon valdez and boards it. there, the deacon is having a celebration, tossing gifts of cigarettes and smeat to the crew, proclaiming they have found the map to dryland. after they have all gone below decks to row, the mariner walks out onto the deck and threatens to drop a flare into the oil reserves unless the deacon releases enola. the deacon, believing that the mariner is bluffing, refuses, so the mariner drops the flare into a vent of the oil reserve tank. the ship explodes, and the mariner escapes with enola by climbing a rope up to gregors balloon. the deacon, still alive, makes a grab for enola, but helen throws a metal object which strikes him in the forehead, causing him to fall into the water. he pulls out his pistol and shoots at the balloon, hitting one of the lines, causing enola to fall into the sea. the deacon and two other smokers, all on jet skis, converge on enola. the mariner ties a bungee cord around his ankle and jumps down to grab enola, pulling her out of the water just as the jet skis collide and explode. gregor deciphers the map, translating the asian symbols using an old and tattered china airlines magazine. he realizes that they are latitude and longitude coordinates, and steers his balloon in that direction. the group finds dryland, which turns out to be the peak of mount everest, still above sea level. gregor, enola, helen and the others land on the island and find the skeletons of enolas parents. they begin civilization anew on the island, but the mariner decides he must leave. enola, saddened to hear the mariner is going, asks why. he explains that he does not belong on land, and that the ocean, his only home, calls to him. he builds a new wooden boat on the beach and sails off.	in a future where the polar ice caps have melted and earth is almost entirely submerged, a mutated mariner fights starvation and outlaw smokers,

for hitler, written by an ex nazi named franz liebkind. they are coerced into performing adolf hitlers favorite tune and swearing the sacred siegfried oath in order to gain liebkinds signature for broadway rights to the musical. they solicit a flamboyant gay director, roger de bris and his faithful theatrical companion, carmen ghia, to direct and choreograph the play. roger initially refuses saying that the musical is far too dark and gritty and that broadway needs to be more gay. he is talked into it, however, after being enticed by max and leo, who tell him that if he directs the play, he is certain to win a tony. then, ulla, a beautiful swedish woman, appears at their office for casting despite there being no auditions. max insists on hiring her as their secretary and auditioning her. to gain the finances for the musical max has dalliances with every old lady across town. max and leo return to the office to discover that ulla has redecorated it to be entirely white. after max leaves, leo laments about ulla and the dangers of sex straying him from his work, but the attraction between them nevertheless culminates in a kiss between leo and ulla. later, at the auditions for the role of hitler, franz becomes angered at a performers rendition of hitlers favorite german song. franz storms the stage and sings the song the correct way. max hires franz to play hitler. on opening night, as the cast and crew prepare to go on stage, leo wishes everyone good luck, to which the players are horrified. they explain to leo that it is in fact bad luck to say good luck on opening night and that the correct phrase is to say break a leg. franz leaves to prepare and, in his rush, literally breaks his leg. max enlists roger to perform the role in his place, and roger accepts. as the show opens, the audience is horrified and begins to walk out until roger steps on stage as hitler. because his performance is so flamboyant, the audience misinterprets the play as an anti nazi parody and a mockery of hitler rather than franzs original vision. as a result, the show is a success and the irs will be keeping tabs on max and leo. after the show, an angry franz starts trying to shoot the producers for, despite his show being a hit, making a fool out of hitler. however, the police arrest him after hearing the shots, but not before he breaks his other leg while trying to escape. max, too, gets arrested for his tax fraud. leo hides away from the police, and ulla finds him hanging on a coat hanging rod then, they escape to rio de janeiro, but they return to

1336534	warlock	1959	warlock is a small utah mining town of the early 1880s. a group of local cowboys led by abe mcquown often comes into town to shoot the place up, kill on just a whim, and beat up and humiliate any lawman who tries to stand up to them. the citizens committee decides to hire clay blaisedell, a renowned gunfighter, as town marshal in spite of the misgivings of some, such as old judge holloway who insists that the situation should be handled within the law. blaisedell is famous for his golden handled guns. blaisedell arrives with his devoted friend, tom morgan, his hero worshiping, club footed, right hand, who is no slouch with a gun himself. morgan has a reputation as a heavy drinking gambler, but blaisedell insists that morgan is part of the package. they even take over the local saloon and rename it the french palace. their first encounter with mcquowns men is without bloodshed, though the cowboys are humiliated and one of them, johnny gannon, stays behind. he has been put off by the gangs activities for some time now and resolves to be more law abiding. some time later morgan learns that his old flame, lily dollar, is coming to town on the stagecoach, and she is accompanied by bob nicholson, brother of big ben nicholson, who was recently killed by blaisedell. lily had left morgan for big ben and knows that morgan pushed ben into challenging blaisedell, who killed him as a result. morgan sets out to meet the stagecoach which is being ambushed by some of mcquowns men as he watches from a distance. he takes advantage of the situation to kill bob nicholson unseen. lily arrives in town and sees morgan there. she believes that he pulled the trigger, although this is based on intuition rather than evidence. the robbers are arrested, sent to bright city for trial, and subsequently cleared by a jury intimidated by mcquown. in the meantime, the bright city sheriff, who disapproves of blaisedell, appoints johnny gannon as official deputy. although he was once a thug himself, gannon takes his law enforcement duties seriously. the scene is set for a number of confrontations between gannon, morgan, blaisedell, and the mcquown gang. wanting revenge for their arrests, the released robbers, led by johnny gannons brother billy, go to warlock to confront blaisedell and morgan. the deputy urgently asks them to leave, and tells billy, i aint backin him, because youre my brother, and i aint backin you, because youre wrong. the outlaws proceed to provoke blaisedell, and he kills two, including billy. soon after, the remaining outlaws try to give themselves legitimacy by posting notices declaring themselves regulators, mocking blaisedells quasi legal status as hired marshal in a town where a sheriff and deputies theoretically enforce the law. what is more, some of the inhabitants are getting tired of blaisedell and morgan, something which, based on previous experience, the pair had predicted would happen. blaisedell, however, has started a relationship with local girl jessie marlow and decides to marry and settle down, much to the surprise of morgan, who wants to move on to another town and insists that clay is nothing without him. gannon, with some assistance from townsfolk, unexpectedly manages to break up the gang without the help of blaisedell, who was kept away from the fight at gunpoint by morgan. it appears that warlock has outgrown its need for the two gunfighters, but morgan cannot tolerate the idea that gannon is now more of a hero than blaisedell. in the course of an argument, blaisedell learns the truth about the deaths of the nicholson brothers, and turns his back on morgan, who resorts to drinking. that evening, in a drunken state, morgan shoots up the town and calls for gannon, but the deputy is locked into his own cell by blaisedell who insists that tom morgans my responsibility. morgan has insisted that he was always covering blaisedells back in almost all their confrontations with their enemies, and that he is the better gunman. to prove his point he shoots off blaisedells hat, and the other, on instinct, shoots back, killing morgan. satisfied that blaisedell is a hero again, morgans dying words are i won, clay, i won the grief stricken blaisedell carries his friends body into the saloon which, to the sound of thunder in the sky, he burns down, giving morgan a viking funeral. the humiliated gannon tells blaisedell that he will arrest him in the morning if he does not leave town. after what has happened, blaisedell cant face staying in warlock and decides to leave anyway. jessie, however, wont accompany him. she insists that she is no tom morgan. lily dollar, for her part, looks as if she takes little satisfaction in finally getting
